Hello WorldSometimes, you might not remember the name of UNIX command and you need to search
for it. For example, if you want to know how to change a file's permissions, you can
search the man page descriptions for the word “permission” like this: man -k permission.
All matched manual page names and short descriptions will be displayed that includes
the keyword “permission” as regular expression.Sometimes you need to run a command on more than one file at a time. The most common
example of such a command is ls, which lists information about files. In its simplest form,
without options or arguments, it lists the names of all files in the working directory except
special hidden files, whose names begin with a dot (.). If you give ls filename arguments,
it will list those files—which is sort of silly: if your current directory has the files duchess
and queen in it and you type ls duchess queen, the system will simply print those file-
names. But sometimes you want to verify the existence of a certain group of files without
having to know all of their names; for example, if you use a text editor, you might want
to see which files in your current directory have names that end in .txt. Filenames are so
important in UNIX that the shell provides a built-in way to specify the pattern of a set of
filenames without having to know all of the names themselves. You can use special char-
acters, called wildcards, in filenames to turn them into patterns. The following provides
the list of the basic wildcards.
